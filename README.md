Task 1: HTML Form Validation Using JQuery
1- Create two forms using HTML & CSS, SignIn and SignUp.
2- The SignIn form should include two fields, username and password.
3- The SignUp form should consist of at least 8 fields of different types to demonstrate
front-end validation for various data inputs.
4- Utilize Pure JQuery to validate both form input fields, with the option to use regex for
this purpose.
Some Examples of Input field validations:
• Input Field should not be empty
• Password must contain special and numeric characters
• Email address must be in a valid format
• Age must be a valid number or within a specified range
